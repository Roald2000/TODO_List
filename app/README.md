# TODO List App

This repository contains a TODO list application built using React. The app allows users to manage their tasks effectively by providing features such as adding, modifying, and deleting TODO items. The user-friendly interface and intuitive design make it easy to stay organized and keep track of your tasks.

## Components

### `App.jsx`

The `App.jsx` component serves as the main entry point for rendering other components and managing the state of the TODO list. It utilizes React hooks such as `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useState` for managing state and side effects. The component also depends on other components like `Form`, `LabelInput`, `FormSubmitButton`, and `DialogModal` for providing a seamless user experience.

### `DialogModal.jsx`

The `DialogModal.jsx` component is responsible for rendering a dialog modal used for modifying TODO items. It accepts props such as `modalID` (the ID attribute of the dialog element) and `modalElements` (the content of the modal, which can be a single element or an array of elements). This component enhances the user experience by providing a convenient way to edit TODO items.

### `Form.jsx`

The `Form.jsx` component renders a form for adding new TODO items. It accepts props like `formID` (the ID attribute of the form element), `title` (the title of the form), `submitButtonLabel` (the label for the submit button), and `onSubmit` (the function to handle form submission). This component ensures a smooth workflow for users to add new tasks to their TODO list.

### `FormSubmitButton.jsx`

The `FormSubmitButton.jsx` component renders a submit button within a form. It accepts props such as `label` (the text displayed on the button), `type` (the type attribute of the button), `className` (the CSS class for styling the button), and `onClick` (the function to be called when the button is clicked). This component enhances the usability of the form by providing an intuitive way to submit tasks.

### `LabelInput.jsx`

The `LabelInput.jsx` component renders a labeled input field. It accepts props like `inputRef` (a reference to the input element), `defaultValue` (the default value for the input field), `labelClass` (the CSS class for styling the label), `htmlFor` (the value for the "for" attribute of the label), `inputText` (the text displayed inside the input field), `inputID` (the ID attribute of the input element), `inputClass` (the CSS class for styling the input field), `type` (the type attribute of the input field), `onChange` (the function to handle changes in the input field), and `required` (a boolean indicating if the input field is required). This component ensures a consistent and visually appealing input experience for users.

### `Helper.js`

The `Helper.js` file exports helper functions related to making HTTP requests and managing modals. It includes functions such as `MakeRequest.fetchData`, `MakeRequest.deleteData`, `MakeRequest.insertData`, `MakeRequest.updateData`, `openModal`, and `closeModal`. These functions assist in fetching and manipulating data from a remote server and provide modal functionality for editing TODO items.
